# Machine learning projects 
This repository hosts the author's realized projects in classical Machine Learning on **Python** and
**R**, systematically partitioned into discrete tasks:
 - Data Manipulation
 - Linear Regression
 - Linear Classification
 - Decision Tree
 - Gradient Descent 
 - Gradient Boosting
 - Other projects
    
The projects also feature a comprehensive comparison of computational efficiency among the three programming languages.
